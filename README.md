# FracturableObjects
Experimenting on fragmentation-tessellation algorithms on Cocos Creator 3.7 and TypeScript.
Going back and forth between image assembler, earcut, delaunay and voronoi. Searching for an optimized way to smash sprites.

DUMB FACT ðŸ’© : As a total newbie (at 2022) when i started on JS and TS, i have to deal with asynchronous operations with a poor (in the best case) knowledge about Promises. A real headache when you are working with interacting elements (i.e. colliders and related triggered procedures). The best i came up with was to perform lockings and enqueues into an static class. Now i learned about promises, i make my own one ðŸ˜„ to ammend that crappy implementation.
